# **Native Apps - Technical Test**

Thank you for taking the time to do our technical test. It should take between 2 and 3 hours to complete - depending on deep you want to go with the tools and the setup. It consists of two parts:

* Coding

* [Technical questions](Senior.Developer.Questions.md)

In order to avoid bounced emails (some ISP's appear to be blocking emails with candidates' test result attachments) we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared Google Drive folder. In order to supply you with the URL for this folder please send an email to tech.recruitment@just-eat.com stating your Google email address. (Alternatively, you can let your agent know your Google address.) If you don't already have a Google email address, please obtain one so that you can be given access to the JUST EAT test results folder. 

Please make this a single zip file named {yourname}-{role-you-apply-for}.zip containing 1 markdown file with the answers to the technical questions and 1 folder containing the technical test.

## Coding

Please pick one of the excercises from here http://cyber-dojo.org/setup/show/ and try to solve it using C++. Please provide unit tests that prove your implementation.

There are no restrictions in terms of implementation details or tools but if you could use Visual C++ compiler and Google test for unit testing would be great. Any compiler and unit testing framework is acceptable however.

### Distributed system

Expose the implementation from the first point over TCP. Create a TCP server that accepts the parameters to your solution and returns the result. The communication protocol between the clients and the server needs to be as simple as possible. The server needs to accept concurrent connections from multiple clients.


Please provide a step by step description on how to build and run the app and the tests.
